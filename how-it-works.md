# How it works

Investors deposit Cardano tokens into liquidity pools, each of which contains two types of tokens.

### Liquidity Pools

In Polyswap, a liquidity pool is a container for two types of tokens. The proportion between the amount of tokens of each type determines the relative price of one token versus the other for that pool. If there are 10 tokens of type A and 100 tokens of type B, then that means each token A is worth 10 tokens B.
